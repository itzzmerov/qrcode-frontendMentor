### What I learned

In this challenge, I remember how hard the basics is. Even if it was just a fundamentals or basic syntax, it is really important to remember it all because sometimes, it might get hard for you to solve a problem just because you can't remember the right syntax of line of coded needed.

```html
<div class="container">
    <div class="wrapper">
      <div class="qrcode-holder">
        <img src="images/image-qr-code.png" alt="QR code">
        <div class="text">
          <h1>Improve your front-end skills by building projects</h1>
          <h3>Scan the QR code to visit Frontend Mentor and take your coding skills to the next level</h3>
        </div>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>
```
```css
